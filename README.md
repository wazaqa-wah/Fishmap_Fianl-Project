# Final Project
This projects aims to look at the fish population for the entire Hudson River. The dataset used is from [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Sensitivity of Coastal Environments and Wildlife to Spilled Oil: Hudson River](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/40343). This fish dataset is chosen specifically because it not only shows the beautiful shape of the Hudson River, but it's also of interest to the author since she has pet fishes since she was a kid. The map shows sensitive biological resource data for marine, estuarine, anadromous, and freshwater fish species in the Hudson River, as well as their species-specific abundance, seasonality, status, life history, and source information. For the purpose of this projects, only the basic information of the fishes is being utilized.
